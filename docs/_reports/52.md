# Add Reporting to Site

> to test mechanics and updates of the site

To close a reporting task with a markdown report:

1. create a new branch for the issue
2. create a markdown file in the repo `docs/_reports/{issue number}.md`
3. open PR where you tag the issue


After PR is merged, the site should add the report to the page, with information about the issue, labels and so on
