# Polygons of Hungarian electoral districts in 2022

## Electoral districts
[**Electoral districts**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district) are subdivisions created for the purpose of electing members to a legislative body.

They are important aspects of creating political strategies and offer an opportunity to concentrate political parties in as few districts as possible, called [Gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering).

## Data descriptions

The data are serialized to [geojson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) format. 

It can be easily read in Python with [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started.html) package.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
gdf = gpd.read_file('file.geojson')
```
