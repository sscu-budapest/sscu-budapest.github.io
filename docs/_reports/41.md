# [Python Package Index - Pypi](https://pypi.org/)

## Introduction

Python has a rich and versatile [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html) immediately available after installation. In other words, Python follows the [batteries included philosophy](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/#id3).

At the same time, Python has an active community that contributes an even more extensive set of packages that users can utilize. Python Package Index (PyPI) is the primary Python software repository.
PyPI hosts an extensive collection of packages, including development frameworks, tools, and libraries.

One readily available information about packages stored at PyPi is their download statistics. These could be useful in a variety of research. For example, examining package popularity or looking at connections between community engagements and the number of downloads.

## Availability and Limitations

[PyPI Stats](https://pypistats.org/about) is the easiest way to access individual package information or monitor ceratin packages for a more extended period. Download stats obtained from the Python Software Foundation's publicly available data on [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). A JSON API is also available. [Pypistats](https://pypi.org/project/pypistats/) Python package provides the API client and CLI tool.

For a more comprehensive study 
it is preferable to use [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). Using PyPI Stats, collecting historical data for every python package or a significant portion could be problematic. For further information [visit](https://pypistats.org/api/). 

Daily download statistics include:
- Number of downloads
- Used Python Major version
- Used Python Minor version
- Used Operating System
- With/Without mirror

PyPI Stats [FAQs](https://pypistats.org/faqs) addresses some data limitations, such as mirrors and data reliability before 2018 July.
