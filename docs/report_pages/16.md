# GitHub

## Introduction

With more than 70 million users ([source and other stats](https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/github-statistics/)), GitHub is the most popular service that provides a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Data about users' behaviour could inspire many data science projects.

## Availability and Limitations

GitHub REST API has quite comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). Thanks to the popularity of the API, there are available [libraries](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/libraries) in multiply programming languages.
