### Money

- split
- how

# Rest

- There is a problem, and an opportunity
  - citing, sharing archiving data is a pain
  - research software is bad
  - reproducibility is an issue

- We would like to make it work
  - reusable, high quality code
  - semantically tagged data
  - easy to rerun
  - automatically updated


adding a small group to a larger community of researches who can utilize them
the role of a research assistant - pride
readable, scalable, re-usable code
