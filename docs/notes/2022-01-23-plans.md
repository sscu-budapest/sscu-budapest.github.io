# [2021-Q4 -> 2022-Q1,Q2](./2022-01-23-plans-slides)

plans, lessons

---

## 2021-Q4

---

### Initial Goals

- create a core catalog of datasets
- present running seamlessly on different environments
  - different parameters
  - subsets / synthetic data
- start decent presentation / communication on [sscu-budapest.github.io](https://sscu-budapest.github.io/)

---

### Tools
- formalize dataset and data project artifacts
- test, profile, automate using GitHub Actions, pytest, pyinstruments
- utilize dvc for versioning, caching, parametrizing

---

### Results - Projects

**no new** project, scrapped plans for any.

existing ones, only partially integrated to the evolving formalization:

- [football](https://github.com/sscu-budapest/football-data-project)
- [mobility](https://github.com/sscu-budapest/mobility)


---

### Results - Data

presenatition got **stuck**

- **Utilized**: GPS pings, Football (odds, transfers, events)
- **Initiated**: Oszk√°r, boardgamegeek.com, pornhub, hasznaltauto
- **Planned**: Twitter, NAV, github, imsdb

---

### Results - Software

#### Primarily
[sscutils](https://github.com/sscu-budapest/sscutils) - the orchestrator for the formalizations of datasets and projects, with a reasonable test suite, at v0.3.1

#### Additionally

Extending and decoupling a set of tools: [colassigner](https://github.com/endremborza/colassigner), [parquetranger](https://github.com/endremborza/parquetranger), [atqo](https://github.com/endremborza/atqo), [aswan](https://github.com/endremborza/aswan)

---

### Lessons

- ad-hoc, but documented, parametrized, manageable exports are key
  - depth, granularity, interconnectability 
- aligning commercial tools with general academic use case is more difficult
- proper dataset presentation is not available ([e.g](./ugly-football-schema.png))
- access and authorization are challenging to solve and communicate

## 2022 - Q1, Q2

---

### Changes

| target | change |
| --- | ---: |
| create a core catalog of datasets | open process, more documentation |
| present running seamlessly on different environments | delay, deprioritize |
| start decent presentation / communication | not bad, set better targets |


---

### Targets - Demo

- entity and composite type based dataset presentation
- easy, straightforward data export
- parametrized pipelines

---

### Targets - Substance

- parallelized io lock issues
- dogshow test suite for full research process simulation
