# Starting a Collaboration

To start or extend a collaboration with us, that results in either the creation or development of a dataset or research project, we suggest you **write an email to {{ site.publisher.email }}**

## What you need to provide

1. Names, affiliations and email addresses of those who are involved and need to be notified of progress
2. Research goals
3. Estimated timeline

## What should happen next

We might open communication if there is need for further clarification or suggestions, but the goal is to as quickly as possible send back:

1. A link to a card on our [task board](https://github.com/orgs/sscu-budapest/projects/2) where you can follow the status of your request and its place in the priority order.
2. When the initial task has been reviewed and moved up the to-do column, a link to the corresponding github issue - sent to the emails listed in the request. There you can subscribe to updates of progress and can discuss details and additional requests.
